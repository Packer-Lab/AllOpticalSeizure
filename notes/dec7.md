# Meeting: Dec 7 2021
### Adam, Prajay

**Items to discuss**

1) possibile windows for 3-4 week data collection blitz trip?
  - animals would have to be 100% ready to go at time of arrival. I can probably make plans with 2-3 weeks of notice?  
  - are there possibilities for doing a combined HPC-optogenetics and cortical Ca^2+^ imaging experiment?
  
2) discuss ambitions for paper - my thoughts on the ceiling of the current project

3) one more quick discussion about modelling my thesis after other alloptical forward theses
   - which ones are most appropriate for me?

4) mm201 collection angle discussion - would 8degrees be good enough? (bergamo is 14degrees)

5) workflow design for processing package

6) progress on measuring responses to seizure distance
- currently implementing code for measuring distance between each cell and the seizure wavefront line

8) reference letter for scholarship application
